Defined Functions:
None

Variables:

activityNames - character vector
	Contains the lines of file activity_labels.txt that holds the mapping for activities.

featureNames - character vector
	Contains the lines of file featureNames.txt that holds the mapping for features which will later be used as headers for the table.

activityNameSplit - list
	Contains the split version of activityNames, separating the numeric from the descriptive pieces of the mapping.

featureNameSplit - list
	Contains the split version of featureNames, separating the numeric from the descriptive pieces of the mapping.

featureNamesCol - character vector
	Contains only the descriptive portion of the featureNameSplit, will be used later as headers of tidyDataFrame

activityNamesFactor - character vector
	Contains only the descriptive portion of the activityNameSplit, will be used later as the factor for tidyDataFrame

subjectTrain - data.frame
	Contains the subjectID data of subject_train.txt

xTrain - data.frame
	Contains the measurable data of X_train.txt

yTrain - data.frame
	Contains the activity data of Y_train.txt

trainDataTable - data.frame
	Is the column-wised combination of subjectTrain, xTrain, and yTrain

subjectTest - data.frame
	Contains the subjectID data of subject_test.txt

xTest - data.frame
	Contains the measurable data of X_test.txt

yTest - data.frame
	Contains the activity data of Y_test.txt

testDataTable - data.frame
	Is the column-wised combination of subjectTest, xTest, and yTest

tidyDataTable - data.frame
	The combination row-wise of trainDataTable and testDataTable. Gets altered later to only hold specified columns

meanCols - integer vector
	Holds the index values of the columns with header containing “mean()”

stdCols - integer vector
	Holds the index values of the columns with header containing “std()”

keepCols - integer vector
	Holds the index values of the columns to extract, a combination of the first 2 columns, meanCols and stdCols

meltedTidyDataTable - data.frame
	Melted down data table that uses subjectID and activity columns of tidyDataTable to create unique combinations to reorganize the data upon.

tidyDataTable2 - data.frame
	Reorganized meltedDataTable that recasts the rows as unique combinations of subjectID and activity and takes the average of each matching measurable column. Later gets exported to a .txt file.
